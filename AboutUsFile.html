	<h1>About Us</h1>
	<div>Hello friends, welcome to the about us page. Our mission is to make money. 
	I mean,support our customers in all of their electronic needs. Because we sell 
	electronics. Some of which actually work sometimes! My story starts long ago. I
	was born in a log cabin in the woods. Times were tough. Especially during the war.
	My one saving gracewas my pet chicken, Theodore Mckinley III. He was my only true 
	friend during my lonelychildhood. My parents made me eat him. 8 years later, and 
	I turned 34 years old. Finally I could leave the house and start my company, A n’	
	A Electronics. The way I came upwith the name, was, I banged my head on a keyboard
	and added the word, Electronics.And that, friend, is the beginning of an era. 
	The A n’ A era. We had a rough start. Andmiddle. And most likely near end. But, 
	our products are the real deal. Need a laptop but the Windows Laptop Surface Pro 
	is too expensive and effective? Look no further to the Doors Laptop Depth Con. 
	It’s the complete opposite of our competitors at “Microsoft”. It’s cheap(er) AND
	(in)effective. Not to mention many, many more products just like it.</div>
